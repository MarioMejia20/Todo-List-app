## What should to know about the requirements

For this project you need to use a mocked user credentials(user: mariomejia, password: flutter2024).

Why I decided to use Hive?
Hive it's a simple way to persist user data locally, as a no SQL database you don't need create a relations between different tables (for Hive we use Boxes) as well, 
to save simple data you only need a Box, but the most important you can save this data encrypted with the methods that Hive provide us.
